# Download

You can download Libre Camera on [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.iakmds.librecamera) by tapping on the badge below. Alternatively, download and install the apk directly from the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/releases) page. Downloading directly from the GitHub releases page will likely download a more recent version (if a new version was published recently) â€“ notice though that the F-Droid and the GitHub versions aren't compatible with one another. You will need to reinstall the app; make sure you remember your settings.

## Translate

<a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/librecamera/"><img src="https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/librecamera/-/multi-auto.svg" alt="Translation status" /></a>

**Translating guide:** Translations are now handled using [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/librecamera/)! To use Weblate, log into your Weblate account and choose one of the 2 components you want to translate: Either the [app itself](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/librecamera/librecamera) or the [F-Droid metadata](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/librecamera/f-droid). Now, select the language you want to translate or add a new language. You will see a list of different strings to choose from; untranslated and unfinished strings will probably be of most interest to you. And finally: Have fun translating!

Before using Weblate you had to translate Libre Camera manually via pull requests. Thank you [@Loughty](https://github.com/Loughty), [@zehrique](https://github.com/zehrique), [@vladkorotnev](https://github.com/vladkorotnev), [@metezd](https://github.com/metezd), [@ZiTAL](https://github.com/ZiTAL) and [@melentan](https://github.com/melentan)!

## Bug Reporting or Feature Requests

Open an issue on GitHub: [Open issue](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/issues)

Remember to check for duplicates and try to give important information such as the app version, Android version, etc.

## Code

Feel free to send in a [pull request](https://github.com/iakmds/librecamera/pulls)! To get started with Flutter, follow this link: [https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)

1. Clone this repository
2. Switch to the project's directory and run `flutter pub get` to get all necessary packages. To test the app, run the project in debug mode by selecting an Android device or emulator in your preferred Flutter IDE and running the app in debug mode
3. To build the final app, run the following command in your terminal: `flutter build apk` â€“ the output apk will be generated at `librecamera/build/app/outputs/apk/release/`. To receive all localized strings, run `flutter gen-l10n`. If you'd like to get multiple apks by splitting them into different platforms (results in smaller sizes), use `flutter build apk --split-per-abi`.
